# AsciiArt
A program to create Ascii Art (it converts images to text).

## Usage

### Prerequisite
You only need to have Go installed (https://golang.org/dl/).

### Setup
You do the following commands in the terminal:

* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Angel-IG/AsciiArt.git`

* Go to the repository: `cd AsciiArt`

* Build the program with the Go compiler: `go build`

### Execution
After the [Setup](#setup), you should have an executable called AsciiArt. To execute it, you have two ways:

1. Do `AsciiArt` and then type the path to the image file you want to convert to text.

2. Do `AsciiArt <path to the image file>`.

After any of those, a browser window with the text version of your image should be open.
